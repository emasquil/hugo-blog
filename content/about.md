I'm a master's student at [ENS Paris-Saclay](http://ens-paris-saclay.fr), which is part of the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr). I'm following the [MVA (Math, Vision, and Learning) M2 Master](https://www.master-mva.com), which is about all the academic topics I love. I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la República, [UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/carreras/grado/ingenieriaelectrica). I like working on Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning in general.

Apart from programming and training neural networks, I like gaming, reading, and playing the guitar. I'm also a football fan and I love supporting my team Club Nacional de Football.

I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay but I'm currently based in Paris, France.

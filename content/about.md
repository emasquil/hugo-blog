I'm a master's student at ENS Paris-Saclay, part of the Université Paris-Saclay. I'm following the MVA (Math, Vision, and Learning) M2 Master, which is about all the academic topics I love. I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la República, [UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/carreras/grado/ingenieriaelectrica). I like working on Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning in general.

Apart from programming and training neural networks, I like gaming, reading, and playing the guitar. I'm also a football fan and I love supporting my team Club Nacional de Football.

I'm currently based in Paris, France.

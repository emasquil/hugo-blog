I'm an Applied Math and Machine Learning Masterâ€™s student [MVA @ ENS Paris-Saclay](https://www.master-mva.com/) and Electrical Engineer [UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/carreras/grado/ingenieriaelectrica). I have an excellent academic background and
solid professional experience as Machine Learning Engineer. I have worked both in the industry and in the academia as
Teaching and Research Assistant.

Currently I'm a Research Intern at [Inria Flowers Team](https://flowers.inria.fr/). I'm working on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically in the Intrinsically Motivated Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Environments project.

Apart from programming and training neural networks, I like gaming, reading, and playing the guitar. I'm also a football fan and I love supporting my team Club Nacional de Football.

I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay but I'm currently based in Bordeaux, France.

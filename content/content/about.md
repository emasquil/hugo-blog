I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la Rep√∫blica, [UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/carreras/grado/ingenieriaelectrica). I like working on Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Machine Learning in general.

Currently I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Tryolabs](www.tryolabs.com).

Apart from programming and training neural networks, I like gaming, reading, playing the guitar and tweeting. I'm also a football fan and I love supporting my team Club Nacional de Football.
